# Belly Button Challenge - Interactive Web Visualizations

This README file provides an overview of the Interactive Web Visualizations dashboard and instructions on how to use it to explore microbiome data.

## Overview

The dashboard is designed to allow users to interactively explore the microbiome data of various individuals. It includes several key components for data visualization and metadata display:

1. **Dropdown Menu:**

Use this to select an individual sample from the dataset. This selection will update the visualizations to reflect data from the chosen sample.

2. **Horizontal Bar Chart:** 

Displays the top 10 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) found in the selected individualâ€™s sample. The OTUs are represented as bars sorted by their frequency.

**3. Bubble Chart**: visualizes all the OTUs found in the selected individual.

**4. Sample MetaData Display**: displays the demographic information of the selected individual. It shows key-value pairs from the metadata JSON object.

**DATA SOURCE**

The data for this dashboard is sourced from the samples.json file, which is stored at the URL provided in the instructions. The JSON file contains the necessary data for creating the visualizations and displaying the sample metadata.
